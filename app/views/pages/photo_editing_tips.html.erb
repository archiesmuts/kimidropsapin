      <h2>The Header Image</h2>
      <p>
        The Header Image is displayed at the top of a post in the index view.
        Only one header image can be uploaded at a time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ideally the header image must be resized with the following dimensions:
        <ul class="image-edit-tips">
          <li>For best results the image should be in landscape format.</li>
          <li>In most cases you only have to change the width.</li>
          <li>Width: 375 pixels (px)</li>
          <li>Height: 189 pixels (px) - approx.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>The Photos in the body of the post</h2>
      <p>
          In addition to the header image you can also upload a number of other
          photos in the body of the blog post.
          <ul class="image-edit-tips">
            <li>
              The photos that you upload in the body of the post can be in
              either landscape or portrait layout format or square if you want.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can decide to have or mix of landscape and portrait for a post or
              choost to have one consistent format for a specific blog post.  It
              makes it easier on the eye of all the photos in a blog have the same format.
            </li>
          </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Ideally the body photos must be resized with the following dimensions:
        <ul class="image-edit-tips">
          <li>In most cases you only have to change the width.</li>
          <li>Width: 550 pixels (px)</li>
          <li>Height: 700 pixels (px) - approx.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Note:</strong> Sometimes portrait photos will be appear "horizontal" in the editor.
            If this happens you have to use the "Rotate" option to change it back to portrait.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>The Editing Tool</h2>
      <p>
        <ul class="image-edit-tips">
          <li>
            There are many online tools available for editing photos. Check out <a href="https://www.befunky.com/create/" target="_blank">BeFunky</a>
            and <a href="https://pixlr.com/editor/" target="_blank">Pixlr</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            Both are easy to use. BeFunky is probably better becase Pixlr needs your browser
            to run Adobe Flash.
          </li>
          <li>
            Before you edit your photos create a special images folder on your PC for each Blog Post.
            <ul>
              <li>Make copies of your orginal photos and place it in the Post folder.</li>
              <li>
                Only edit copies of your original photos. Remember the edited photos will
                be much smaller in size than the originals.
              </li>
              <li>
                This smaller sizes are important as it saves space and costs,
                and it makes your website much faster to browse.
